- Create a form that has a handle submit func
  -this context and binding ????????
  - event.preventDefault()
  - What would we expect in our server from a form submission?

- Use a handle change to allow for some front end (realtime) validation before form submission
  - Why is this needed? Why not just let them submit the form and check the inputs?
  - How do you handle the data in the form? Where to we store it?

- How do we handle multiple inputs?
  - What are some issues with how we have this current form filled out?
  
- Lets Change the user inputs to upperCase.
  - Did we let the user see this change?
  - What is a controlled form???
